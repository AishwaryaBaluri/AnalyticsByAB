## Portfolio Projects
In this section, I detail the use of various technologies to solve real-world business cases. Each project demonstrates my approach to harnessing data insights for strategic decision-making.


### <ins>Call Center Trends Analysis Dashboard</ins>

**Goal:** To Create a dynamic Power BI dashboard to track call center trends, focusing on long-term customer and agent behavior trends. The dashboard aims to provide transparency and actionable insights for strategic decision-making.

**Description:** This Project involve development of a comprehensive Power BI dashboard designed to visualize crucial metrics and performance indicators of a call center's operations. The dashboard effectively showcases data on customer satisfaction, calls answered, call resolution efficiency, and agent performance metrics. It includes DAX Measures, KPI's, and dynamic Slicers to allow users to interactively filter data according to specific requirements enhancing the dashboard's usability and responsiveness.
  
**Skills:** Calculating Measures (DAX), Defining KPIs, Power BI Dashboard Development, Effective Data Visualization, Generating Insights and Actions, Interactive Reporting, Performance Optimization, User Experience Design
  
**Technology:** Power BI, DAX, Power Query, Excel
  
**Results:** Analysis revealed that out of *5,000 total calls*, *4,054 were answered*, and *946 were unanswered*. Of the answered calls, *3,646 were resolved*, highlighting areas for potential improvement in call resolution and response efficiency. The average response time was 67.52 seconds. The dashboard also provided insights into customer satisfaction by topic and agent performance, identifying key areas for improvement. Dynamic filtering features enhanced the utility of the dashboard, facilitating targeted analysis and aiding in strategic decision-making.

### <ins>Analyzing Top 5 Categories for a Successful IPO</ins>
**Goal:** To identify and analyze the top five categories with the largest popularity to aid in preparing for a successful IPO.

**Description:** I initiated the project by gaining a clear understanding of the business requirements, which facilitated the integration of three distinct datasets: Reactions, ReactionType, and Content. After merging the data, I carried out comprehensive cleaning and preprocessing to ensure the datasets were accurate and suitable for analysis. I then conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to detect significant trends and relationships. This analysis led to the development of detailed visualizations using advanced Excel tools and Power Pivot, which helped illustrate the insights clearly. The project concluded with the implementation of storytelling techniques to effectively communicate the key findings, supporting the strategic decisions for a successful IPO.

**Skills:** Project Planning, Data Understanding, Data Cleaning, Data Preprocessing, Data Modeling, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Visualization

**Technology:** Advanced Excel Functions, Power Pivot, Excel Charts

**Results:** Advanced Excel analysis showed that Studying, Healthy Eating, and Technology are the top trending content categories. Additionally, GIFs and Photos are the most engaging types of content, with 84% of reactions being positive.
